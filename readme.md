## Laravel PHP showcase with private area

This is a small Laravel application made to test and improve my knowledge of such a framework.<br />
It's a showcase website with a private area using custom made APIs.<br />

#### The application contains a few sections, pages and features:

- The home page and the showcase page both extracting their content from a Sqlite database.
- A sign in and a login page both relying on a custom made API.
- Emails for the sign up and the recovery of the password.
- A user private area with the list of payments made and pending payments, grabbing the data from Stripe through API.
- Multi-language support
- Material design
